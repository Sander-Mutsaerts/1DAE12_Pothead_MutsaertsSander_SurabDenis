Zombie survivor topdown shooter game where you go through waves and your score increases.

(do if extra time)
Quality of game experience improvments:

Procedural maps (or more maps)
Different types of ammo (if we invent health system -> damage if not maybe different weapons can
			 fire multiple shots, explosive ammo(can kill adjecent zombies))

Different types of boxes (health/time it takes for zombie to destroy)
Graphical improvements to sprites
Adding a menu?
Different types of zombies (sprites, health, speed)
Traps? (maybe you can set them up like normal walls but the zombies will not identify them like
	normal walls so they can collide with them and when they do they die)
Shield system? (player can have a shield pick up that works as temp health)
Pick ups (weapons, ammo, special effects(speed,...), )
Different player classes (health, appearence, starting gun, )
Special ability [it can differ with classes](some ability that can be charged up by killing 
					     zombies or by "surviving" time)
		: increased firerate, invincibility, kill all zombies on screen, shoot in all 
		  directions, (if health system gain an ability to oneshot),
